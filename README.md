This is the very first grbl fork for my Japanese Desktop Mill that was repurposed to do pick and place.
Was forked from

GRBL_VERSION "1.1h"

GRBL_VERSION_BUILD "20190830"


-------------
Hardware

This runs on a plain Arduino Uno (with a atmega328p Device).

It supports a 4th  axis: the C_AXIS

C_Axis Step pin is Uno Digital Pin 12

C_Axis Direction pin is Uno Digital Pin 13

Spindle Enable is moved to Uno Analog Pin 3 - It can be used for Vacum Solenoid Valve On/Off

Spindle Direction and Variable Spindle Speed are not available

Z Axis Limit switch is moved to Uno Digital Pin 11

Hence with minimal hardware rewiring you should get your 3-Axis Desktop Mill that was running original Grbl to perform Pick And Place.

Supports all G-Codes as in Grbl v1.1 with:

 - Additiona Non-Command Word: C

This work is an integration of Bob Beattie's OpenPnP-Grbl with the Offical Grbl

While Bob Beattie's port runs on AtMega2560 this runs on Arduino Uno with Atmega328p
